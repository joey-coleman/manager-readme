# Manager README

Hi!  I'm Joey Coleman, I work at [Kira Systems](https://kirasystems.com/) as "Director, Systems" — my team is responsible for our production systems.  This document is about me, how I work, how I hope others will work, and how I hope to interact with (mostly) people on my team and (less so) people not on my team.

Warning: this is a first draft.  With luck, there'll be a second draft, and frequent enough updates over time that this evolves and becomes useful.


## Why this README?

Why not?  Seems like all the cool kids are doing it these days.

I deal with complex systems daily, and I deal with humans; the former is the easy bit and the latter doesn't even ship with a manual.  So, here's one for me — it's probably wrong in all kinds of interesting ways, but at least you get to call me on it.


## My role (as I see it)

My role has two major parts: technical and leadership, and those have a great deal of overlap.

I try to lead in line with the "Servant Leadership" philosophy, in that I want to provide my team the means and resources to get things done, and then get out of the way.  Everyone I've hired I've done so with confidence that they are both able and willing to get things done.  I also see myself as an imperfect model — while I'm sure that some of my behaviour is not worth emulating, and I'm sure that I could improve other behaviour, I do try to not to exhibit those that are counterproductive.

Technically, I try to spend about half my time "in the weeds", and as much of that as possible fitting together bits and pieces that either have a high ambiguity quotient, or a high (but maybe risky) payoff for the team.  Sometimes I'm the oracle — I am responsible for the current architecture of our production system, and I know far too many arcane details of why and how it was put together.


## My values

* Honesty — I am direct, often blunt, and I appreciate this in others, even when I don't like the message.

* Humility — Not even sure how to express this; nobody likes a braggart is too simple, and too obvious.  Being able to say "I don't know" and understand limits is golden.

* Confidence — This is not in paradoxical opposition to the last: my experience is that those that are insecure are often among the least humble folk I've met.

* Competence — Beyond the obvious skill-based meaning, this includes the self-awareness of knowing what one is competent in.

* Curiosity — This is foundational: personal growth in technical fields is driven by curiosity.  Also, I find incurious people hell to work with.

* Applied laziness — Put positively, the drive to automate away any and all manual work.  Life is not well spent doing the same repetitive thing over and over again.

I like the "Directly Responsible Individual" idea — that, once a person takes or is given a task, it's incumbent on them to own it and not be chased to finish it.  There's always an out — directly admitting that one cannot do a task (alone), and asking for help, or another to lead.


## Expectations

### What I expect from you

* I hope to see some degree of the things I value, of course, though I am aware that those are my values, and not necessarily yours.

* Fix problems where and when you see them.  This necessarily must be tempered with an understanding of why the problem exists, and why it persists.

* Sensitivity first to the confidential nature of the data we keep, then to the control regimes we operate under.

* A certain esprit de corps — the Systems Team is a team, and we must be able to depend and rely on each other.  


### What you can expect from me

* 1:1s — I believe these are important, but I'm flexible as to how we do them.  Every fortnight at worst, weekly is also fine.  I expect timing and duration will vary over time.  However, if we haven't sat down to chat within the past fortnight, I _should_ be putting a block in your calendar.  These are for both of us — I may have updates from the organizational context that I want to discuss with you; you may have things you want to discuss with me.

* Trust — Right now, everyone on my team is someone that I interviewed and, with the input from the rest of the team (and other people I trust), I chose to bring into the team.  If I ask you to work on something, it's because I trust you can do it, and I trust that you will tell me if and when you need help.

* Challenges — Related to the last, I will give you things that I think (or hope!) will stretch your skills.  Sometimes I'll ask beforehand, but sometimes it will be based on overall team and organizational goals.

* Communication


### What will disappoint me

* Silently giving up — If you're overwhelmed, ask for help.  Being overwhelmed is not a mark against you, but rather a missed judgement call on my part.  Giving up and not asking for help is a choice you control; I would rather help and recalibrate expectations than be upset that something didn't get done.

* Failing to learn — While our infrastructure isn't bleeding edge, it's _far_ from traditional, and we're actively working to make things better.  Sitting and holding to what you've always done in the past, only _because_ it's the way you've always done it, is not sufficient justification.  (Best practices are only best because we haven't yet figured out better, not because there is no better.)


## Quirks

* The biggest part of my background is academia, and I argue like many of the academics I've met: full of noise, passion, and vigour.  And when we're done that session, the passion stays with the ideas and we go for beer.
